|[HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)|The hdbscan library is a suite of tools to use unsupervised learning to find clusters, or dense regions, of a dataset. The primary algorithm is HDBSCAN* as proposed by Campello, Moulavi, and Sander. The library provides a high performance implementation of this algorithm, along with tools for analysing the resulting clustering.|
